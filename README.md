About

This repository is centered on a heart disease detection system built through machine learning. It utilizes the UCI Heart Disease dataset and applies classification models to determine the probability of a patient having heart disease. The trained models are serialized using pickle for easy reuse.

Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Likely includes scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, SVC), pandas, numpy, pickle for model persistence

Dataset: UCI Heart Disease dataset

Model Serialization: Pickle

Project Structure (Assumed from file list)

Based on the visible files, a probable layout might be:

/
â”œâ”€â”€ heart_app/               # Main application scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ README.md                # (Youâ€™re creating this)


Files inside heart_app/ may include:

Data loading and preprocessing scripts

Model training routines (e.g., train_models.py)

Evaluation and visualization modules

Model saving (pickle.dump) and loading

Setup & Usage
Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Install dependencies (e.g., scikit-learn, numpy, pandas) via:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Steps

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/NishanthVishwas/Heart-Disease-Detector-ML.git
cd Heart-Disease-Detector-ML


Prepare the dataset

Ensure the UCI Heart Disease dataset is in the expected location (e.g., heart_app/data/).

Run training script

python heart_app/train_models.py


This likely handles:

Data preprocessing

Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)

Model evaluation (metrics like accuracy, ROC)

Saving models using pickle

Use the trained model

python heart_app/predict.py --input "<feature_vector>"


(Assuming there's a script to make new predictions.)

Modeling Workflow

Load dataset â€“ Read the UCI dataset and inspect features

Preprocess data â€“ Handle missing values, scale features, encode categorical variables

Train models â€“ Fit multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)

Evaluate performance â€“ Compare using cross-validation and metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC)

Save best model â€“ Serialize using pickle for future inference

Evaluation & Output

Typical outputs you might generate:

Accuracy comparison across models

Confusion matrices and ROC AUC scores

Saved model files (model_logreg.pkl, model_rf.pkl, model_svm.pkl)

Prediction scripts to load and test new patient data

Future Enhancements

ðŸŒŸ Bundle into a Streamlit or Flask app for a user-friendly interface

Add hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Implement better feature engineering and model explainability (e.g., SHAP)

Provide a well-formatted requirements.txt and usage documentation

Integrate unit tests for data processing and model inference
